# 🧠 Personal Memory Agent

A conversational, memory-first system designed to act as a private second brain.

Unlike traditional todo or reminder applications, this project focuses on long-term memory, contextual retrieval, and reflection — not disposable tasks.

## Overview

Personal Memory Agent allows users to store life events using natural language and retrieve them conversationally. Every interaction becomes a structured, searchable memory that contributes to a persistent timeline.

---

## Features

- Conversational chat-style interface  
- Memory-based storage (not task deletion model)  
- Rule-based natural time parsing (e.g., tomorrow, next Monday, in 2 hours)  
- Smart reminders  
- Time, category, and tag-based retrieval  
- Daily and weekly summaries  
- Hybrid categorization (fixed categories + flexible tags)

## Example Commands

```bash
